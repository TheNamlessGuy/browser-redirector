## Usage
The plugin allows you to redirect from one URL to another. For example, you might be like me and hate the youtube shorts page. With one of the default options, all shorts pages get redirected to the proper view page (this can of course be removed or changed).  
You can also block access to pages completely, which - again, per default - the plugin does with reddit.  
The above two options exist to show you how to work the plugin, really. Just visit the plugin option page when you've installed the plugin, and you should get it no problem, as long as you know regex.

One thing to note however, is that it might take a little while on boot to properly load all your regexes (if you have a LOT). You should be able to see this process by the little loading icon in your browser URL bar, while the processing is going on.
